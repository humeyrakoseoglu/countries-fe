# Countries Project Front-End

## About The App
Rest APIs created by the back-end in the countries-be repository in my GitHub profile were used in the project.
- Countries pulled using API.
- It is possible to search by Country ID or Country name. (Search as you type)
- There are 2 options as ListView or GridView.
- The list can be sorted in descending or ascending order according to country phone codes.
- Multiple filtering can be done according to Continent, Currency and PhoneCode properties.
- Clicking on the list elements opens the detail page and displays all the country's information. With the Delete button on this page, the record of the relevant country can be deleted in the database.
